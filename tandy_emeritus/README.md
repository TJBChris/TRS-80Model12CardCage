# Tandy Emeritus - Related Items

## About
This page contains items created by Tandy Emeritus in support of their Model 12/16B/6000 backplane.  See the descriptions below for each item here.  I didn't create these items, but it made sense to host them here as part of the larger Model 12 expansion project.

## Items

These are the TE-provided items I have here for the card cage project:

* cage_insulator - A plastic insulator for the TE backplane when it is paired with the factory metal card cage found in a 12, 16B, or Tandy 6000.  **This part is not necessary for the 3D-printed card cage in this repository.**  See the README page in this folder (or the TE backplane documentation) for instructions.
